- Still need to add "CALLMINE" detection for a better dot file in fractal.pl
script. For this purpose, parsing .fractal file is not enought, need to parse C
files.
- Add version number and '-v' option.
- Supress "DATA." string in case of instance variables for a component instance.
- Better DECLARE_DATA management.
- C comments detection.
